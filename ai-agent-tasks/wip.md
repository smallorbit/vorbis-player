- [x] ~~Create audioplayer-refactoring subdirectory~~ ✅
- [x] ~~Create audioplayer-refactoring/README.md overview~~ ✅
- [x] ~~Document Phase 1 tasks in phase1-extract-hooks/~~ ✅
- [x] ~~Document Phase 2 tasks in phase2-component-decomposition/~~ ✅
- [x] ~~Document Phase 3 tasks in phase3-state-simplification/~~ ✅
- [x] ~~Document Phase 4 tasks in phase4-type-safety-cleanup/~~ ✅

**STATUS: ✅ DOCUMENTATION COMPLETE**

All refactoring tasks have been documented with comprehensive implementation plans. The initiative is ready for execution.

### Key Findings from Analysis

**AudioPlayer.tsx Issues Identified:**
- 385+ lines in single component
- 24 destructured state variables
- Complex 50-line `playTrack` function (lines 146-196)
- Song end detection logic mixed with component (lines 234-277)
- Color extraction logic embedded (lines 293-315)
- Deep prop drilling and mixed concerns

**Refactoring Strategy:**
1. **Phase 1**: Extract business logic into custom hooks
2. **Phase 2**: Break down into smaller focused components
3. **Phase 3**: Simplify state management and reduce prop drilling
4. **Phase 4**: Improve type safety and extract utilities

**Target Outcome**: Reduce main component to ~150 lines while improving maintainability
