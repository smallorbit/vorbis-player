*This file tracks the current state of all AI agent initiatives. Update as work progresses.*

## Current Active Initiative: Fix Background Color Consistency (Issue #60)

**Status**: Complete  
**Start Date**: 2025-10-30  
**Objective**: Make background colors consistent across initial loading, playlist selection, and player screens

### Completed Tasks
- [x] **Task 1**: Updated PlaylistSelection.tsx Container background - *Removed custom gradient background to inherit from app background*
- [x] **Task 2**: Verified PlayerStateRenderer.tsx LoadingCard background consistency - *Confirmed semi-transparent backgrounds work consistently*
- [x] **Task 3**: Verified all backgrounds are consistent across the app - *Checked all main containers inherit body background*

### Summary of Changes
- **File Modified**: `src/components/PlaylistSelection.tsx`
  - Removed `background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1a1a2e 0%, #16213e 50%, #1a1a2e 100%);` from Container
  - Now inherits consistent `#242424` background from body element (index.css)
  
### Result
All screens (loading, playlist selection, and player) now have consistent background colors:
- Body background: `#242424` (from index.css)
- All main containers inherit this background
- Semi-transparent cards (`rgba(38, 38, 38, 0.5)`) render consistently across all screens

- [x] **Task 3**: Set Up Container Queries - *Planned modern CSS container query implementation*
- [x] **Task 4**: Create Sizing Hook - *Designed usePlayerSizing hook for dynamic calculations*

### Phase 2: Core Sizing Implementation
- [x] **Task 1**: Replace ContentWrapper - *Replaced hardcoded ContentWrapper with responsive wrapper using usePlayerSizing hook*
- [x] **Task 2**: Implement Fluid Dimensions - *Replaced all hardcoded dimensions with fluid calculations across VisualEffectsMenu, PlaylistDrawer, VisualEffectsPerformanceMonitor, PlaylistSelection, TimelineSlider, and AlbumArt components*
- [x] **Task 3**: Add Aspect Ratio Support - *Handle different screen orientations and ratios*
- [x] **Task 4**: Create Responsive Components - *Updated SpotifyPlayerControls component with responsive sizing using usePlayerSizing hook*

### Phase 3: Advanced Responsive Features
