**Detailed Instructions:** See [deploy-to-vercel.md](./deploy-to-vercel.md) for step-by-step instructions.

**CLI Deployment:**
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy

# Or deploy preview
npm run deploy:preview
```

### Manual Build Deployment

For other hosting services:

```bash
npm run build
```

The `dist/` folder contains static files that can be deployed to any web hosting service (Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.).

**Important**: 
- Update the Spotify redirect URI in your app settings to match your production domain
- Ensure your production domain is whitelisted in your Spotify app settings
- Set up environment variables on your hosting platform

## Troubleshooting

### "No tracks found"

- Ensure you have a Spotify Premium subscription
- Create playlists with music or like some songs in Spotify to build your Liked Songs collection
- Check that your Spotify account has music accessible
- Verify your Spotify app has the correct scopes and permissions

### Authentication Issues

- Double-check your Client ID in `.env.local`
- Ensure redirect URI matches exactly in both `.env.local` and Spotify app settings
- Use `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` for Spotify OAuth compatibility
- Try clearing browser storage and re-authenticating

### Performance Issues

- Clear localStorage to reset user preferences: `localStorage.clear()` in browser console
- Refresh the page if the app becomes unresponsive
- The app is optimized for continuous playback and smooth transitions
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors if issues persist

### Visual Effects Issues

- If visual effects aren't working, try refreshing the page
- Clear localStorage to reset visual settings to defaults
- Ensure your browser supports CSS filters and backdrop-blur effects
- Try disabling browser extensions that might interfere with visual effects
