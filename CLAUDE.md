## Architecture

### Component Hierarchy

1. **App.tsx** - Handles Spotify OAuth authentication flow and renders the main AudioPlayerComponent
2. **AudioPlayer** - Main orchestrator that manages audio playback, track selection, and album art display using centralized state management
3. **PlayerStateRenderer** - Handles loading/error/playlist selection states
4. **PlayerContent** - Main content when playing (album art + controls)
5. **SpotifyPlayerControls** - Refactored three-column control interface with sub-components:
   - **TrackInfo** (left column) - Song name and artist display
   - **ControlsToolbar** (center) - PlaybackControls + playlist button
   - **TimelineControls** (bottom) - EffectsControls + ColorPicker + VolumeControl + Timeline + LikeButton
6. **AlbumArt** - Displays album artwork with customizable visual effects and filters
7. **PlaylistDrawer** - Sliding drawer interface showing track listing with current track highlighting
8. **VisualEffectsMenu** - Side sliding menu for controlling visual effects with real-time sliders

### Hook-Based State Management

The application uses a centralized state management approach with the `usePlayerState` hook:

- **usePlayerState.ts** - Central state management with grouped state objects (track, playlist, color, visualEffects)
- **usePlayerSizing.ts** - Responsive sizing logic for mobile/tablet/desktop
- **usePlaylistManager.ts** - Playlist loading & Liked Songs management with shuffle functionality
- **useSpotifyPlayback.ts** - Spotify playback control and track management
- **useSpotifyControls.ts** - Volume, like, timeline controls
- **useAutoAdvance.ts** - Auto-advance logic for seamless track progression
- **useAccentColor.ts** - Color extraction from album artwork
- **useCustomAccentColors.ts** - Per-track color overrides
- **useVisualEffectsState.ts** - Glow state management
- **useVolume.ts** - Volume state management
- **useImageProcessingWorker.ts** - Web worker for image processing
- **useProfilerData.ts** - Performance profiling

### Service Layer

**Spotify Services**:
- **spotify.ts** - Spotify Web API integration for playlists and authentication, includes comprehensive track library management functions:
  - `getUserPlaylists()`: Gets user's playlists
  - `getPlaylistTracks(playlistId)`: Gets tracks from specific playlist
  - `getLikedSongs(limit)`: Gets user's liked songs with pagination
  - `checkTrackSaved(trackId)`: Checks if track is saved in user's library
  - `saveTrack(trackId)`: Saves track to user's library
  - `unsaveTrack(trackId)`: Removes track from user's library
- **spotifyPlayer.ts** - Spotify Web Playback SDK wrapper with state management

### Utilities

**Core Utilities** (from src/utils/):
- **colorExtractor.ts** - LRU-cached color extraction with improved performance
- **colorUtils.ts** - Color manipulation utilities
- **sizingUtils.ts** - Responsive sizing calculations
- **performanceMonitor.ts** - Performance tracking

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Liked Songs Not Loading
- **Root Cause**: Missing user-library-read scope or no liked songs in account
- **Solution**: Verify Spotify app scopes and ensure user has liked songs
- **Location**: Check `spotify.ts` getLikedSongs() function

### Album Art Filters Not Working
- **Root Cause**: Missing `albumFilters` prop in AlbumArt component
- **Solution**: Always pass `albumFilters={albumFilters}` to AlbumArt component
- **Location**: AudioPlayer.tsx line ~704

### Performance Issues
- **Color Extraction**: Ensure colorExtractor.ts cache is properly implemented
- **Component Re-renders**: Verify React.memo is applied to heavy components
- **Bundle Size**: Check that lazy loading is properly configured

### Type Inconsistencies
- **Filter Types**: Ensure filter interfaces match between components
- **Invert Property**: AlbumArtFilters expects boolean, VisualEffectsMenu uses number
- **Solution**: Standardize on single type across all filter components

### Development Workflow
- **Single server**: Use `npm run dev` for development
- **Visual effects testing**: Test all filter combinations for performance
- **Component hierarchy**: AudioPlayer â†’ AlbumArt â†’ AlbumArtFilters for filter application
- **Performance monitoring**: Use React DevTools Profiler for performance analysis

## Performance Optimizations

### Key Metrics to Track
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: Target < 1.5s
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Target < 2.5s
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: Target < 3.5s
- **Bundle Size**: Target < 500KB gzipped
- **Track Transition Time**: Target < 200ms

### Tools for Monitoring
- **Lighthouse**: For Core Web Vitals monitoring
- **Bundle Analyzer**: For bundle size analysis
- **React DevTools Profiler**: For component performance
- **Web Vitals Library**: For real-user monitoring

### Implemented Optimizations
- **Color Extraction Caching**: LRU cache in `colorExtractor.ts` with 100 item limit for 50-60% faster transitions
- **Component Memoization**: React.memo applied to heavy components like AlbumArt and VisualEffectsMenu
- **Lazy Loading**: VisualEffectsMenu and other heavy components loaded on-demand
- **Resource Hints**: DNS prefetch and preconnect for Spotify API and image CDNs
- **Bundle Optimization**: Code splitting and tree-shaking for reduced bundle size
